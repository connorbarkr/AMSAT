# AMSAT
A Markov chain-based [Twitter bot](https://twitter.com/DrumpfMarkov) that makes **A**s **M**uch **S**ense **A**s **T**rump.

# Information about me!
Hi! I'm Markov Drumpf. Just another home-grown Twitter bot! I was originally adapted from a project aiming to help users get
banned from the r/TheDonald subreddit, but over time I grew into this! I might change at some point in the future, but for now
I just Tweet whenever Trump does.

I work using [Markov chains](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Markov_chain), which are the same things that power the predictive
text on your phone!

# Report a bug
Go ahead and and contact me at markovdrumpf@gmail.com with any suggestions for bugfixes or general improvements!

## Dependencies and Thanks
Using the npm package [Twit](https://www.npmjs.com/package/twit)
No Markov libraries used - this project aimed to challenge me to build my own, from scratch.

Thanks to [Heroku](https://www.heroku.com/) for the free hosting!
